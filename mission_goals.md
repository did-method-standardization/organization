# DID Method Standardization: Mission & Goals

## Introduction

This document outlines the high-level mission, goals, and expected outcomes for the DID Method Standardization initiative. It serves as a strategic guide for stakeholders involved in the development and adoption of [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core).

## Mission

We aim to drive Decentralized Identifier adoption through standardization maturity and ecosystem engagement, as follows:

1. Leading open, collaborative standardization efforts
2. Identifying approaches that empower organizations to independently drive DID method standardization
3. Cultivating ecosystem-wide awareness and participation.

## Goals

1. Select, and advance standards for, an initial set of strategically valuable DID methods across three key categories: (a) web-based method, (b) ephemeral method, (c) decentralized method
2. Advance the above DID method standards to maturity in collaboration with appropriate Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) for each method (e.g., W3C for did:web / did:tdw)
3. Develop approaches for scalable, independent DID methods standardization (such as grouping by traits), enabling organizations to drive and govern their own DID method standardization efforts
4. Facilitating broader community coordination to support DID method standardization efforts across the ecosystem, including: 
    1. Engaging with various standards groups, organizations, and individuals interested in DID method creation and standardization
    2. Promoting knowledge sharing and best practices across the community 
    3. Enabling discovery of efforts and collaborators

## Objectives

To achieve these goals, we will pursue the following objectives:

### DIF Working Group with Joint Participation

A new “DID Method Standardization” working group (WG) at the [Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)](https://identity.foundation/) will perform the following activities in support of Goals 1 and 3.

1. Identify and standardize the initial set of DID methods
    * Identity methods of strategic value across 3 categories: (a) web-based method, (b) ephemeral method, (c) decentralized method
    * Determine methods by working group consensus approval, considering criteria such as standards maturity, adoption, future potential, and community engagement
    * Document criteria for selecting methods
2. Develop mechanisms to assist broader DID method standardization
    * Identify categories for grouping DID methods to facilitate cross-cutting standardization efforts
    * Coordinate with [DID Traits](https://identity.foundation/did-traits/) and [DID Rubric](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric) efforts
    * Propose development of shared standards and testing mechanisms
3. Prepare work for handover to external standards bodies, where relevant
    * Develop comprehensive specifications, conformance criteria, test suites, interoperability guidelines, security requirements, and privacy requirements

The DIF working group will operate according to DIF's established processes and Work Item Lifecycle.

Additionally, this DIF working group will offer a member sharing agreement, allowing members of agreed-upon organizations to participate with no additional cost or friction besides signing the WG Feedback Agreement. Participating organizations may be added by the WG chairs. The initial set of organizations included are the following:

* [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/)
* [W3C Decentralized Identifier Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/did/)
* [Trust Over IP Foundation](https://trustoverip.org/)


### Additional SDO Working Groups

To advance the initial set of DID method standards to maturity (Goal 2), we will propose the creation of working groups at SDOs of strategic importance for each method.

At this time, we intend to launch a W3C working group that will:
* Continue standardization of web-based and decentralized DID methods incubated in the DIF Working Group
* Complement and inform the existing W3C DID Working Group
* If agreed upon by the working group participants, identify a fallback, mandatory-to-support method

Working groups at additional SDOs may be initiated depending on the DID methods selected, and the determination of the DIF working group.

### Ecosystem coordination

Goal 4 will be achieved initially through the [did-method-standardization GitHub organization](https://github.com/did-method-standardization), with the following activities: 

* Foster Ecosystem Collaboration
    * Engage with standards groups, organizations, and individuals interested in DID Method creation and standardization
    * Facilitate knowledge sharing and best practices across the community
* Promote DID Adoption
    * Increase confidence in DID technology through standardization
    * Demonstrate practical applicability of DIDs across various use cases
* Enabling discovery of efforts and collaborators

## Expected Outcomes

* Mature specifications for initial DID methods, enabling improved interoperability
* Establishment of a new W3C DID Methods Working Group (and other standards org groups TBD)
* Test suites and conformance criteria, with consideration to reuse by other DID methods
* Improved collaboration between DID-related working groups and standards organizations
* Community forums for ongoing standardization discussions
* Increased adoption of DIDs across various sectors
* Proposal for subsequent standardization by categories of DID Methods
* Guidelines and best practices for DID method standardization, wherever the work is happening

This effort may result in:
* Recommendations for a "fallback" or mandatory-to-support DID method
* Open source software that facilitates using the standardized methods in multiple programming languages/environments
* Updates or additions to infrastructure that makes use of the standardized methods (e.g. the universal resolver, open source resolver drivers)


## Additional Considerations

As the DID Method Standardization initiative evolves, the following aspects will be developed and regularly reviewed:

* Project timeline, success metrics, and resource allocation
* Regulatory requirements and alignment
* Interoperability with existing systems
* Clarification of governance structures
* Risk assessment and mitigation 
* Security and privacy considerations
* User adoption strategies, including education, outreach, and pilot programs
* Continuous improvement processes, incorporating stakeholder feedback
* Methods for assessing and communicating ecosystem impact
* Alignment with existing efforts in relevant standards bodies

These considerations will be elaborated and adjusted as the project progresses to ensure alignment with evolving requirements and ecosystem buy-in.
